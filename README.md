# Medicine-Manager
Like a task manager except for your daily meds. You can make a list of your medications and what time they are to be taken, and you can check each off.

Abilities to implement:

- Add a medicine (when you click a button a prompt will appear that will have you enter the name of the medication, dosage, time it should be taken, and whether or not it should be taken with food)
- Remove a medicine (when you click a medicine on the list a delete button will appear. The delete button will prompt you to confirm you want the medication to be deleted)
- Edit a medicine (when you click a medicine on the list an edit button will appear. It will bring you to the same prompt as when adding the medication)
- Timer (tells you how long until your next medication)
